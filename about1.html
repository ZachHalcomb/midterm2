            <P class = "font">Outside of School, I live with and help my grandpa with housework and shopping. I also spend time with my parents during the weekend and at church. In my free time, I enjoy messing around with and researching computer hardware and software, along with playing video games. </P>

            <P>I enjoy building computers mainly for the fact that you can create a system that gives you more value and freedom then buying a prebuilt computer or laptop from a company such as Apple or HP. I originally built my computer in 2017, but have upgraded the CPU, RAM, and storage in order to support virtual reality games and work for college. I have also built and managed my families and friendsâ€™ computers for them.</P>

            <p>I own two cats, Cougar and Max, who are both strays that we have taken in. My parents have also adopted a cat named Gus who comes with my mom when she visits. I like cats, mainly because each one has its own personality and interests. However, I would prefer having a dog for its company and companionship.</p>
